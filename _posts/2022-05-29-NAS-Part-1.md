Hi. Been a while. Sorry about the little haitus. I have been working on multiple projects and I don't think I've made considerable progress to write about yet, but it will be coming very soon!

# Backups

Anyways. I applied for a 3D designer position. Although my portfolio was not very impressive which I knew when I applied, but gave it a shot anyway. Didn't land it :(. But in the process of building my portfolio, I realized that I have a lot of files and projects that are not backed up. This has bothered me for some time, but going through all my projects, I didn't want to lose 4 years and 1000+ hours worth of work, and that's only Blender projects. I have many documents, and files that need to be backed up (around 1 TB), so I thought I should figure out some way to back up all my files.

# NAS

Now I should preface this by saying that I very new to this field and if you have any suggestions please let me know at <hamzaalsarakbi@gmail.com>

So I'm very lazy when it comes to manually plugging in my external HDD and copying over specific files. I want to automate all that process in a sustainable way. So, I thought of building a little NAS and have it serve 3 functions.

1- An automatic weekly backup of all the computers in the house

2- A vault where I can store sensitive documents and files that I don't want on my computer or just any files that I want to offload onto the NAS

3- Run Docker containers ([Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), webservers, maybe [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/your-media/) and [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/), etc.)

## Hardware

### Storage

My setup for now is 3x4TB NAS HDD's in RAID 5. so the total storage is 12 TB but the total usable storage is 8 TB because the parity spread across the 3 drives amounts to 4 TB. This setup gives me the most usable storage and in case of a failing HDD, I can just replace said HDD and rebuild. I'm also thinking of maybe encrypting the drives on the NAS, although still undecided.

I have a 250 GB M.2 NVME SSD for the OS and whatever containers I'll be running.

I might add a 128 GB SSD for caching, although I'll look into that later.


### Other components

My 2 options are either getting a prebuilt NAS server or a DIY setup. I went for a DIY setup for the fun of it and because I want to host multiple projects so an ARM processor ain't cutting it for me.

Parts list:

- **CPU**: [Intel Core i3-10100 3.6 GHz Quad-Core Processor](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/products/sku/199283/intel-core-i310100-processor-6m-cache-up-to-4-30-ghz/)

- **Motherboard**: [ASRock B560M Pro4 Micro ATX LGA1200](https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/B560M%20Pro4/index.asp)

- **Memory**: [Kingston FURY Beast 8GB (1 x 8GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory](https://www.kingston.com/en/memory/gaming/kingston-fury-beast-ddr4-memory)

I don't think dual channel is critical for my use case so I went for a single stick

- **Case**: [Fractal Design Node 804 MicroATX Mid Tower](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/node/node-804/black/)

- **Power Supply**: [EVGA GD 500W 80+ Gold Certified](https://www.evga.com/products/product.aspx?pn=100-GD-0500-V1)

The whole setup with storage amounts to around $973.77 after tax.

I still haven't bought any components yet since I might change some parts. I might opt for a Pentium CPU since I probably won't need 4 cores unless if I end up hosting a Plex server. Regardless, let me know what you think!

## Software

I'll be running [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org/) which is just a Debian fork aimed at NAS servers. It has a nice WebUI so you don't have to remote into the NAS every time you try to access it.


This is it folks! Again let me know your thoughts at <hamzaalsarakbi@gmail.com> or Hamzaaa#9224 :)
